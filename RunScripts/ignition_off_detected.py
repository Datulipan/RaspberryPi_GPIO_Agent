import time

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Script Purpose:
# This script contains a sequence of tasks that are executed when the car's
# ignition is detected to be turned off. It's structured to be run directly
# when called by an external GPIO monitoring daemon.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Log or print the event for debugging or records. 
# In a real-world scenario, you might want to log this to a file or a database.
print("Ignition has been turned off!")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Delay Handling:
# Introduce a delay if necessary for various reasons such as:
# - Allowing other processes to complete
# - Waiting before initiating certain tasks due to power or other constraints
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
time.sleep(10)  # Example: Wait for 10 seconds. Adjust the duration as required.
print("10 seconds passed since ignition turned off!")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Additional Tasks:
# Insert any additional tasks that need to be executed in response to the 
# ignition being turned off. For clarity and maintainability, consider adding 
# comments describing the purpose and functioning of each task.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For example, you could add tasks like sending a notification, saving data to 
# a file, or shutting down other devices or systems.

# Note: Always test the script in a controlled environment before deploying it 
# in a live setting to ensure all tasks execute as expected.
